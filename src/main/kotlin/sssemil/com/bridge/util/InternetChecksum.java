     * Calculate the Internet Checksum of a buffer (RFC 1071 - http://www.faqs.org/rfcs/rfc1071.html)
     * Algorithm is
     * 1) apply a 16-bit 1's complement sum over all octets (adjacent 8-bit pairs [A,B], final odd length is [A,0])
     * 2) apply 1's complement to this final sum
     * <p>
     * Notes:
     * 1's complement is bitwise NOT of positive value.
     * Ensure that any carry bits are added back to avoid off-by-one errors
     * <p>
     * From https://stackoverflow.com/a/4114507/3119031.
